    <h1>What Is an Object?</h1>
    <p>
        Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and
        you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television
        set, your bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior.
        Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging
        tail). Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed)
        and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes). Identifying
        the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in
        terms of object-oriented programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take a minute right now to observe the real-world objects that are in your immediate
        area. For each object that you see, ask yourself two questions: "What possible states
        can this object be in?" and "What possible behavior can this object perform?". Make
        sure to write down your observations. As you do, you'll notice that real-world objects
        vary in complexity; your desktop lamp may have only two possible states (on and off)
        and two possible behaviors (turn on, turn off), but your desktop radio might have
        additional states (on, off, current volume, current station) and behavior (turn on, turn
        off, increase volume, decrease volume, seek, scan, and tune). You may also notice that
        some objects, in turn, will also contain other objects. These real-world observations
        all translate into the world of object-oriented programming.
    </p>

    <p>
        Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of
        state and related behavior. An object stores its state in fields (variables in some
        programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming
        languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism
        for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to
        be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation - a fundamental
        principle of object-oriented programming.
    </p>
    <p>Consider a bicycle, for example:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../assets/images/oop/bicycle-object.gif" alt="A bicycle modeled as a software object.">
        <figcaption>A bicycle modeled as a software object.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        By attributing state (current speed, current pedal cadence, and current gear) and
        providing methods for changing that state, the object remains in control of how the
        outside world is allowed to use it. For example, if the bicycle only has 6 gears, a
        method to change gears could reject any value that is less than 1 or greater than 6.
    </p>
    <p>Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Modularity: The source code for an object can be written and maintained
            independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object
            can be easily passed around inside the system.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the
            details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software
            developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to
            implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to
            run in your own code.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be
            problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different
            object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the
            real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.
        </li>
    </ol>
