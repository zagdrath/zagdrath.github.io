    <h1>Introduction to PID Control</h1>
    <p>
        A PID controller is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is commonly used in industrial control
        systems and a variety of other applications. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value \(e(t)\)
        which is the difference between the desired setpoint \(r(t)\) and the currently measured process variable \(y
        (t)\) and it applies a correction based off of the proportional, integral, and derivative terms, hence the
        naming of PID.
    </p>
    <p>
        The calculation of error is defined as the desired setpoint \(r(t)\) minus the currently measured process
        variable \(y(t)\), see Figure 1 below.
    </p>
    <figure>
        \(\displaystyle {\large e(t)=r(t)-y(t)}\)
        <figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Control Theory</h2>
    <p>
        The PID control scheme is named after its three terms used in correction; the sum of those terms and
        calculations constitute the controller's final output \(u(t)\). See Figure 2 for the final equation of the PID
        controller. It is important to remember that a PID controller can be used without having all terms fulfilled, in
        place of those terms a 0 is substituted during configuration of the constant gains.
    </p>
    <figure>
        \(\displaystyle {\large u(t)=K_pe(t)+K_i\int e(t)dt + K_d\frac{de}{dt}}\)
        <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Proportional Term</h3>
    <p>
        The proportional term produces the controller output \(u(t)\) which is proportional to the current error value
        \(e(t)\).The proportional control response is adjusted by multiplying the error value \(e(t)\) by the
        proportional gain constant \(K_p\), see Figure 3 below for the equation that proportional control performs.
    </p>
    <figure>
        \(\displaystyle {\large u(t)=K_pe(t)}\)
        <figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        When the proportional gain constant is too large in value it can cause a large change in the controller output
        response for the given error which can cause a system to become unstable. Inversely, when the proportional gain
        constant is too small in value it can cause a small controller output response and the controller will be less
        responsive and less sensitive. Thus tuning of the proportional gain constant is important in order to have a
        responsive and sensitive controller.
    </p>
    <h3>Integral Term</h3>
    <p>
        The contribution of the integral term is proportional to the magnitude of the error value \(e(t)\) and the
        duration of the error value. The integral in the equation of a PID controller is the sum of the accumulated
        error over time and it provides the accumulated offset that should have been corrected on previous iterations.
        The accumulated error value \(e(t)\) is then multiplied by the integral gain constant \(K_i\) and it then gets
        added to the controller output \(u(t)\). Please see Figure 4 below for the equation that integral control
        performs.
    </p>
    <figure>
        \(\displaystyle {\large u(t)=K_i\int e(t)dt}\)
        <figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The integral term is responsible for accelerating the movement of the process towards the given setpoint and
        should eliminate the residual steady-state error that occurs with just a proportional controller. However, since
        the integral term responds to the accumulated errors from previous iterations, it can cause the currently
        measured process value to overshoot the desired setpoint value. Overshooting is when the measured value exceeds
        or goes higher in value than what the desired value is.
    </p>
    <h3>Derivative Term</h3>
    <p>
        The derivative term is responsible for the calculation of the derivative of the error value and it does this by
        determining the slope of the error over time and multiplying that by the derivative gain constant \(K_d\) and
        it then gets added to the controller output \(u(t)\). Please see Figure 5 below for the equation that derivative
        control performs.
    </p>
