As you may notice the site looks very 90s and that is because it is, I designed it to be very similar to some of the first WWW webpages. Just so you know, the views expressed here are my personal views, not those of any organization I represent. What's the purpose of this website? Well I don't fully know myself but I view it as a creative outlet and somewhat as a personal social media of sorts. It is a site I developed to publish all sorts of content.</p>\n        <h2>Link Directory</h2>\n        <p>Below are links to various websites that I believe contain important or useful content.</p>\n        <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"33%\" class=\"table-align\">\n              <ul>\n                <li><a href='https://distrowatch.com/'>DistroWatch</a> is a website that provides news, information, and other general information about various GNU/Linux and BSD distributions.</li>\n                <li><a href='https://gifcities.org/'>GifCities</a> is a project of the <a href='https://archive.org/'>Internet Archive</a> to preserve and search through many of the GIFs once used on GeoCities.</li>\n                <li><a href='https://templeos.org/'>TempleOS</a> is a free, public domain, 64-bit operating system entirely custom designed and developed by the great Terry A.
