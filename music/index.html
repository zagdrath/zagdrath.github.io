        Here is a place where I may list some of the music I listen to and give recommendations
        or reviews on some albums.

    <h4>Osaki Seiichi - The Tale of a Long Forgotten Sunken City</h4>
    <p>
        Osaki Seiichi is an artist from Nagoya, Japan who creates ambient, progressive and
        experimental art and connects it through multiple medias. Listening to this album 
        of his seems to be very reminiscent of Hiroshi Yoshimura's work and I believe it 
        to be inspired by his work. If you don't know who Hiroshi Yoshimura is, he is 
        considered to be a pioneer of ambient music in Japan.

        This album actually tells a story, or an aventure as it goes along. The story of each 
        individual song is dictated on <a href="https://osakiseiichi.com/#/sunken-city-story">
        Osaki's website</a>. We first begin with <i>Wandering Through The Ancient, Sunlit 
        Alleyways</i>, a song which is full of beautiful melodies that just blend together so 
        incredibly well with ethereal bells ringing while the sounds of the ocean envelop 
        around you. The story of the first song and exploration goes like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        There is an ancient story surrounding this part of the island. The tale goes something 
        like this. Once upon a time, in the middle of a burning sunny day, a boy wandered into 
        the sea, not knowing what lies ahead. He was stumbling and couldn't walk straight, but 
        somehow he knew where to continue. As the sunlight hit his eye, out of nowhere, a city 
        appeared. He felt confused but wanted to explore this mysterious city. The ancient, 
        sunlit alleyways made him dizzy and tired. He fell and hit his head.
    </p>
    <p>
        We then come on to the second part of our adventure, <i>Awoken by the Mysterious Sounds / My 
        Life Might End</i>. Here we are greated by the great unknown out in the deep. As our adventure 
        goes along the music seems to get ever so slighly more tense to go along with the story. The 
        beautiful blends of melodies seem to continue but in a rather most unknown place. The second 
        part of our story goes like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as the boy woke up, sudden worry, anxiety and unease were upon him. He saw a 
        silhouette but not a human one. He could hear eerie sounds in the distance and knew 
        they were coming closer. Scared to the bone, he couldn't even catch his breath before 
        snake-like creatures pointed a trident at his throat. They took him. Surrounded, he 
        couldn't defend himself. They forced him to go with them, not knowing if he would survive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon we are approaching the end of our journey as we know it for now as we reach the third 
        and last song of this album, <i>The Cathedral of Secrets / Dashing From the Tridents / Relief, 
        it's Over</i>. We continue to delve deeper into the great unknowns of this beautiful and great 
        city down in the deep. The beautiful melodies around us now begin to almost darken and become 
        heavier as a showing of what is to come with this story of ours and it goes like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        They approached a big gate. The Cathedral Of Secrets was in front of them. They let him in. 
        The creatures talked for hours about the city and the story surrounding it. The boy realized 
        he couldn't go back home, and he had to stay and become one of them. As this realization came 
        to him, he tried to break free. Rushing, he managed to leave the Cathedral Of Secrets, having 
        creatures right behind his back. He dashed from the tridents, fighting for his life. He made 
        several turns through the alleyways as creatures screamed at him. The boy managed to lose them. 
        Thinking it was over, he felt relief. But then suddenlyâ€¦

        This album by Osaki Seiichi was just absolutely incredible, the whole atmosphere of the story 
        given to us by him and the ethernal and melodic music that goes with it beautifully. I really 
        do recommend listening to this album and reading the small bits of story that he gives us to 
        go along with each song and indulge yourself in the story that he has created, this all gives 
        it a sense of uniqueness and invovlement. I am very excited to see what else comes with Osaki 
        Seiichi.
