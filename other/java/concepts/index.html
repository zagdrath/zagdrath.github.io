        If you've never used an object-oriented programming language before, you'll 
        need to learn a few basic concepts before you can begin writing any code. This lesson will 
        introduce you to objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages. Each discussion 
        focuses on how these concepts relate to the real world, while simultaneously providing an 
        introduction to the syntax of the Java programming language.

        <li>1.1 <a href="">What Is an Object?</a></li>
        <ol class="squat">
            <p class="squat">
                An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are 
                often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. This 
                lesson explains how state and behavior are represented within an object, introduces 
                the concept of data encapsulation, and explains the benefits of designing your software 
                in this manner. 
            </p>
        </ol>
        <li>1.2 <a href="">What Is a Class?</a></li>
        <ol class="squat">
            <p class="squat">
                A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines 
                a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses 
                on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <li>1.3 <a href="">What Is Inheritance?</a></li>
        <ol class="squat">
            <p class="squat">
                Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your 
                software. This section explains how classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses, 
                and explains how to derive one class from another using the simple syntax provided by the Java 
                programming language.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <li>1.4 <a href="">What Is an Interface?</a></li>
        <ol class="squat">
            <p class="squat">
                An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an 
                interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface. This section defines 
                a simple interface and explains the necessary changes for any class that implements it.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <li>1.5 <a href="">What Is a Package?</a></li>
        <ol class="squat">
            <p class="squat">
                A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing 
                your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage. This section explains 
                why this is useful, and introduces you to the Application Programming Interface (API) provided 
                by the Java platform.
