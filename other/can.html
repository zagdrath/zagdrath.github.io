    <h2 class="squat">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="squat">Controller Area Networks (CAN) are a robust commnucations standard that 
    was designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other's 
    applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol and it was designed 
    for multiplex electircal wiring in order to save on copper, but it can be used in many 
    other contexts. The data in a frame is  transmitted sequentially but in such a way that 
    if more than one device transmits at the same time, the highest priority device can 
    continue while the others back off. Frames are received by all devices, including by the 
    transmitting device. CAN is commonly used in automotive, agricultural, robotics, and 
    embedded control applications.</p>
    <h2 class="squat">OSI model layers</h2>
    <p class="squat">The CAN protocol, just like many other networking protocols, can be 
    broken down into many different layers that each have different functions. If you 
    would like to learn more about the OSI model, please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">here</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="squat">Transport layer</h3>
    <p class="squat">Many parts of the CAN standard apply to the transport layer.</p>
