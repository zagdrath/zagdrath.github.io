    <h2>HP 5334A/B Programming Commands</h2>
    <p>
        All local functions are programmable with individual command codes via the
        interface. In general, all functions operate the same in remote as in local.
        The HP 5334A/B device commands are described in the following paragraphs, and
        listed in Table 1-1, HP 5334A/B Programming Command Set. The individual commands
        are organized into groups for ease of description and use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the alpha characters, used to represent each function in the command set,
        are underlined on the front panel of the counter. For example, in the MATH/MEMORY
        group the "M" for the group label, and the "D" for DISABLE are underlined; the alpha
        character set for Math Disable is MD.
    </p>
    <h3>Command Group Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
        INPUT GROUP. Most commands in the input group are equivalent to pressing a key, or a
        sequence of keys on the HP 5334A/B front panel, when the counter is in the local mode
        of operation. The binary commands in this group are equivalent to a single key stroke,
        and set the corresponding parameter to "ON" (1), or "OFF" (0). Numeric commands, AT
        and BT, require a numeric entry that sets the corresponding trigger level to a specific
        voltage. Integer commands, XA and XO, are equivalent to the local EXT ARM SELECT KEY
        sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
        FUNCTION/DATA GROUP. All commands in the function/data group represent a corresponding
        HP 5334A/B front panel key. All function (FNn or FUn) commands are integer commands
        that require a numeric entry after the alpha characters. The "n" represents the number
        equivalent to the function selected, as listed in Table 1-1. When a function command is
        recieved it enabled the corresponding measurement mode. To disable a measurement mode,
        another function command must be sent.
    </p>
    <p>
        GATE GROUP. Commands in the gate group are equivalent to pressing a key or a sequence of
        keys, on the HP 5334A/B front panel, when the instrument is in the local mode. The GS and
        GV commands, equivalent to a single key stroke, are bindary commands that set the corresponding
        parameter to "ON" (1), or "OFF" (0). Numeric commands, GA, require a numeric entry that
        sets the gate time to a specified value.
    </p>
    <p>
        MATH/MEMORY GROUP. Commands in the math/memory group are equivalent to pressing a key or
        a sequence of keys, on the HP 5334A/B front panel, in the local mode of operation. The MD
        command, equivalent to a single key stroke, is a binary command that sets the corresponding
        parameter to "ON" (1), or "OFF" (0). Numeric commands, MN and MO, require a numeric entry
        that sets the corresponding math operation to a specific value. Integer commands, MR and MS,
        are equivalent to the local STORE and RECALL key sequences. (The MR and MS commands are not
        valid for the HP 5334B.)
    </p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous and Special Functions</h3>
    <p>
        HS1 (High Speed Output Mode On): High speed mode sends the HP 5334A/B measurement data to
        the counter in binary form. The data is sent in 8 bytes, terminated by an EOI with the last
        byte. In this mode the counter is capable of sending measurement data at the rate of 150
        measurements per second. When the HS1 command is sent, it palces the HP 5334A/B in the high
        speed output mode. The coutner displays the message "FASt dAtA" while high speed measurements
        are being taken.
    </p>
    <p>
        HS0 (High Speed Output Mode Off): The HS0 command takes the counter out of the high speed
        output mode and allows it to function in the normal remote state.
    </p>
    <p>
        ID (Device Identification): When the ID command is sent, the counter will identify itself
        to the controller the next time the counter is addressed to talk. The string "HP 5334A/B"
        will be sent, followed by a cariage return and a line feed. The coutner will wait until
        the device ID is read by the controller, then resume taking measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
        IN (Initialize): The IN command causes the instrument to exit its current state and go to
        the power-on initalized state. If the instrument is in an error state, error conditions
        1.0 through 4.4 will be cleared by the "IN" command, however, errors 5.0X through 5.2
        and failures will not be cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
        The initalized states are set as follows: All gate, math/memory, and input signal conditioning
        will be OFF; the function will be FREQ A (FN1), with AUTO TRIG (AU1) and autoattenuation ON;
        gate time will be set at 300 milliseconds; math offset value will be set at +0, normalize value
        at +1; the input A (AT) and input B (BT) trigger levels wil be set at 0 volts, and the internal
        trigger/sensitivity levels will be OFF (dACS OFF).
    </p>
    <p>
        RE (Reset): The reset command clears the current measurement and restarts a new measurement.
        However, unlike the REST/LOCAL key, the RE command does NOT clear errors 5.0X through 5.2,
        nor any failures.
    </p>
    <p>
        SMn (Service Request Mask): Upon receipt of the Service Request Mask Command (SMn), the
        instrument will load the binary value of "n" into the service request mask register. The
        "n" represents the binary sum of the bits (conditions) you want enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        SM0 (Service Request Mask Off): Sending the command "SM0" masks off (or disables) all SRQ
        conditions. Then this command is sent no condition will enable a service request.
    </p>
    <p>
        TC (Transmit Calibration Data): When the controller sends the TC command, the counter sends
        a string of calibration data, preceded by a "C", and followed by a carriage return and a
        line feed. The counter will wait until the calibration data is read, then resume taking
        measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
        TE (Transmit Error): When the transmit error command is recieved, the instrument will send
        the number of the detected error to the controller. The TE command clears the Error bit
        (bit 2) in the counter's serial poll byte. It is recommended that "TE" be send in a string
        by itself, not at the end of another string. The counter will discontinue normal operation
        until the error message is read. Not that reading the error code will not clear the error.
    </p>
    <p>
        WA1 (Wait To be Addressed Mode On): WA1 palces the instrument in the wait to be dddressed
        Mode. The wait to be addressed mode forces the instrument to suspend subsequent measurements,
        and wait for the current measurement to be read by the controller. This mode is especially
        useful when used with the service request. The instrument will make a measurement, then
        alert the controller that data is ready by asserting SRQ when the measurement is completed.
        This frees the controller to perform other functions while the measurement is available.
    </p>
    <p>
        WA0 (Wait To Be Addressed Mode Off): WA0 takes the isntrument out of the wait to be addressed
        mode, and allows it to function in the normal remote state. In the normal state, measurements
        are made continously, whether or not they are read by the controller.
