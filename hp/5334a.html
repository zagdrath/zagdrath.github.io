                <p class="squat tab">
                    The 5334A is a two-channel, 100 MHz Universal Counter with 9 digits in one
                    second resolution and 2 ns single shot time interval resolution. Frequency,
                    period, rise time, fall time, pulse width and peak amplitude may be measured
                    automatically&mdash;all at the touch of a button. Options include a high-stability
                    oven oscillator, a + / - 1000 V DVM and a 1.3 GHz C-Channel.
                </p>
                <h3 class="squat">Fully Programmable</h3>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    Complete HP-IB capability standard is a first for counters in this class, opening up new
                    possibilities for ATE applications. All front panel controls are programmable including 
                    input signal conditioning and trigger levels. Optional rear terminal inputs simplify cabling
                    in rack-mounted systems.
                </p>
                <h3 class="squat">Peak Amplitudes</h3>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    The peak amplitude function adds a new dimension to to universal counter applications.
                    For any waveshape up to 20 MHz, the 5334A measures not only time and frequency, but also
                    the maximum and minimum peak amplitudes of Channel A or B input signals. Often this function
                    reduces the need for additional test equipment and gives a more complete picture of the input signal.
                </p>
                <h3 class="squat">Input Signal Conditioning</h3>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    In addition to automatic capability, independent selection of input signal conditioning provides
                    flexibility for any application. Accurate triggering is ensured by selection of trigger slope,
                    coupling, input impedance, attenuation, low pass filter, and variable sensitivity. Variable 
                    sensitivity may be used to widen the hysteresis band for measurements on noisy input signals. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="squat">Triggering Alternatives</h3>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    The 5334A offers four alternatives for trigger level selection. Auto Trigger offers maximum
                    convenience. The maximum and minimum peaks of the input signal are found automatically, and the
                    optimium trigger point calculated. Auto Attenuator is enabled with Auto Trigger, ensuring correct
                    counting by selecting the X10 attenuator when the input signal amplitude is greater than the input
                    signal operating range.
                </p>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    The trigger levels may also be set manually over the range of -5.10 V to +5.10 V (-51.0 V to +51.0V 
                    in X10 attenuation). Read Levels may be used to display the current trigger level control settings.
                    Storing trigger levels from the front panel and programming trigger levels over HP-IB complete the 
                    alternatives for reliable and accurate triggering.
                </p>

                <h3 class="squat">Store / Recall</h3>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    Up to ten instrument setups includding trigger levels may be stored in a nonvolatile memory and 
                    conveniently recalled. Sequencing through several complicated setups require much less time and
                    results in repeatable, exact measurement setups.
                </p>
                <h3 class="squat">Math</h3>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    Math functions let you view results in measurement units of your choice such as velocity, flow,
                    or ppm. Normalize divides the measured value by a constant. Offset adds or subtracts the measured
                    value by a constant.
                </p>
                <h3 class="squat">External Arming</h3>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    Synchronize a measurement to a real time event or events. Start arm is used alone to enable the
                    start of a measurement, stop arm to enable the stop of a measurement. External gating is acomplished
                    by arming both the start and stop of a measurement. This capability facilitates applications such as
                    measuring the frequency within a pulsed RF signal and averaging for increased resolution, selecting a
                    specific time interval within a pulse train, and selecting a portion of a pulse train to totalize.
                </p>
                <p class="squat tab">
                    The arm input and slope selection are conveniently located on the front panel and are programmable over
                    HP-IB. The trigger level at which the arm signal will arm a measurement may be selected from -4 V to +4 V
                    via a rear panel control.
                </p>
