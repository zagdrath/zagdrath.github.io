One of the most important pieces obviously is the cable, so I am currently\r\n          trying to source some Belden 9880 cable for this network. My father may have some\r\n          in a shed so I will be going to look to see if it is what I need.</p>\r\n        <p>Update February 18, 2022: I checked out the cable and the cable he was talking about ended up being\r\n          TFC T-10, which is very similar to RG-6/U and is 75 Ohm rather than 50 Ohm RG-58A/U\r\n          cable that I need for 10BASE2 networking. This cable obviously is not exactly correct\r\n          for 10BASE2, but it should be able to work at a short distance for me until I am able\r\n          to source some 10BASE5 or proper 10BASE2 cable for cheap. There also was a spool of\r\n          RG-8, which is very similar to 10BASE5 cable but it ended up not being solid core,\r\n          so I am unable to use it with the vamprire taps. I also bought a 3COM Etherlink\r\n          XL PCI 3C900-COMBO card for my client systems and a Cabletron ST-500 transceiver\r\n          that comes with an AMP 228752-1 vampire tap. Below are some images of the TFC\r\n          T-10 cable and other parts I have gotten so far for this project. I also\r\n          ordered some Klein Tools BNC connectors and a special crimper tool from them\r\n          to put the ends on the cables.</p>\r\n        <p>Update February 23, 2022: I recieved the PCI card and I still need to install it in my Sun Ultra 20 to test it and take some pictures of it. The Klein Tools compression crimper and ends also came today, so I made one cable as a test. The ST-500 transceiver is actually coming from India and I did not realize that, so it will be awhile before it arrives. But in the meantime, I need to order some BNC T connectors and terminators.</p>\r\n        <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\">\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td width=\"33%\" class=\"table-align\">\r\n              <StaticImage src='../../images/t10.png' alt='TFC T-10 Cable' />\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td width=\"33%\" class=\"table-align\">\r\n              <StaticImage src='../../images/3com.png' alt='3COM Etherlink XL PCI 3C900-COMBO' />\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td width=\"33%\" class=\"table-align\">\r\n              <StaticImage src='../../images/st500.png' alt='Cabletron ST-500' />\r\n            </td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </table>\r\n        <Link to='../../writings'>&lt;-- Back</Link>\r\n      </main>\r\n      <Footer></Footer>\r\n    </body>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Export component\r\nexport default Retro\r\n"],"names":["charset","width","border","class","S","src","alt","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
